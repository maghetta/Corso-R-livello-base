ELIXIR Italy provides training in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology to help researchers effectively utilise bioinformatics tools, databases, and resources. [The ELIXIR Italy Training Platform](https://elixir-iib-training.github.io/site/) offers workshops, training courses, and seminars on various topics at the intersection of biology, computer science, statistics, and more. These events are designed to provide researchers with hands-on experience and practical skills to analyse biological data, and offer opportunities for participants to network, collaborate, and exchange knowledge with others in the field.
<br>
<br>
More specifically, the ELIXIR Italy Training Platform offers the following:
<br>
<br>
**Specialized training** in areas such as genomics, proteomics, structural biology, systems biology, and more. These training sessions may cover both basic concepts and advanced techniques.
<br>
**Online resources** such as tutorials, webinars, video lectures, and documentation that researchers can access remotely. These resources are often valuable for self-paced learning.
<br>
**Data analysis training** to teach researchers how to analyse and interpret biological data using bioinformatics tools, software, and pipelines.
<br>
**Hands-on practice** where participants work with real or simulated datasets to gain practical skills.
<br>
**Tailored training programmes** for specific research groups, institutions, or projects, depending on their needs and interests.
<br>
**Training infrastructure**, namely access to computing resources and software needed for the training activities, ensuring participants can follow along with the hands-on exercises.
